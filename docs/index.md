Visualize your Pi-hole in Splunk! If you've landed on this app, it's probably because you are running your own super awesome Pi-hole® server. If not, check it out! [https://pi-hole.net/](https://pi-hole.net/)

This app works with the [Pihole DNS Add-on](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4505/) add-on which provides the field extractions necessary for this app.

This Splunk Add-on is community driven and not affiliated with the official [Pi-hole®](https://pi-hole.net) application. As such, the included documentation does not contain information on how to get started with the Pi-hole DNS server. Rather, this documentation serves as a guide to help visualize the data in Splunk. Please visit [https://pi-hole.net](https://pi-hole.net) for documentation on installing/configuring your own Pi-hole server.

## Key Features

* Allows for easier troubleshooting of blocked queries.
* Prebuilt dashboards that allows you to drill-down to specific queries for further analysis.
* View daily trends and easily identify if queries are outside the month's norm.
* Test Regex filters before applying them on the Pi-hole server.
* View a list of all DHCP clients.
* Identify errors that may be a result of a misconfiguration.
* Check the DNS queries across all Pi-hole instances in a single place.
* View Allow and Deny filters setup across all Pi-hole servers.
